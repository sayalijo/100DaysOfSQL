Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Table Triangles:
A integer
B integer
C integer

A B C
------
20 20 30
20 20 20
20 21 22
13 14 30

Sample Output
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle


Explanation
Values in the tuple (20 20 30) form an Isosceles triangle, because A==B.
Values in the tuple (20 20 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A=B=C.
Values in the tuple (20 21 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A != B != C.
Values in the tuple (13 14 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side .
